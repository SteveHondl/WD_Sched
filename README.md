# Work Day Scheduler

## Description 

In this project, I have added JavaScript code to an a already existing CSS and HTML template.  This challenge started with writing a function using dayjs that will keep the schedule on the current date and time as long as they refresh.  Once implemented, the following function will allow the user to save information entered to local storage and receive an alert that the appointment has been saved.  The final step was creating a for loop that will show past, present, and future events via a color coding system.  Overall, this was fun project that shows a lot of purpose for every day use.
